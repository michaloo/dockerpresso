# CHANGELOG

## v2.0.2

Smaller improvements

- don't mount volume to local directory - which can be changed breaking some commands
- add this changelog file

## v2.0.1

Hotfix for broken comment.


## v2.0.0

This release simplifies dockerpresso:

- no other dependencies than bash
- dockerpresso is supposed to be installed in /usr/local/bin or similar place instead of in each project
- no separate templates files, everything is in one bash script
- no custom docker images or installers, I know I already wrote that, but this is just a single bash script now
- commands simplified and reworked for easier usage
- documentation slightly updated


## v0.0.1

Initial version
